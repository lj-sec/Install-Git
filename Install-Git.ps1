.SYNOPSIS
This is a PowerShell script to install the latest 64-bit Git for Windows with installer-selected defaults and minimal user interaction.

.DESCRIPTION
Git will install system-wide if:
    You are in a PowerShell instance that is running as Administrator
    You are running as a non-Administator but allow the installer access to the system via UAC
Git will install only for the current user if:
    You cannot (due to permissions) allow the installer access to the system via UAC
    You run this script with the `-UserInstall` parameter (it will still prompt for UAC if you have permission to elevate, select Yes)
Git will cancel the installation if:
    You have permission to allow the installer access to the system via UAC yet choose not to

Multiple installations of git may conflict, not every edge case has been tried
RUN AT OWN RISK

Multiple inst
.EXAMPLE
iex "(& {$(irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lj-sec/Install-Git/Install-Git.ps1)})"

.EXAMPLE
iex "(& {$(irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lj-sec/Install-Git/Install-Git.ps1)} arg -UserInstall)"

.PARAMETER UserInstall
This changes the directory of the installation to the AppData\Local\Programs of the current user.
This in turn forces git to install user-specifically instead of system wide when the user has permission to allow it to.
